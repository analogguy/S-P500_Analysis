# S-P500_Analysis
Study of the behaviour of the S&amp;P500 trading in the last minutes of trading, versus performance the day after.

We will notice the significant rise in volatility in S&P 500 daily change in Q1 2020. I also added a 3 days SMA, in order to monitor the osciallting trend.
Then we will see Tesla stock change over a year versus a less volatile stock such as Apple.
